# **1.1 Writing a simple program**

Every C++ must have a **main** function. 

**For example**
```CPP
    int main ()
    {
        retun 0;
    }
```
A function definition has four elements:

1. a return type,
2. a function anme,
3. a parameter list inside the parentheses,
4. a function body.

Our **int main()** function requires a return type **int**, we can easily see that even though our program do nothing we are returning a **zero** which is an integer number.

The value returned from **main** is a status indicator. A **zero** indicates sucess, a **nonzero** return has a meaning that is defined by the system.
