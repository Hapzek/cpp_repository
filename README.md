As an **electronics engineer** I learned C++ applied to microcontrollers, this way of programming is very different compared with how CS students program. I know how to make IoT projects with an Arduino UNO/Nano/Mega, ESP32 and 18FXXXX microcontrollers, but I lack of data structure knowledge, I don't know what's a pointer or how to make a STL template.

At a beginner level this mean nothing, but I want to learn ML, AI and robotics. In this disciplines it's very important to know why, and how stuff is done, it's not enough to make things work, so, in order to reach my dreams I decided to start learning C++ from zero, I'll be using "C++ Primer" by Stanley B. Lippman, Josée Lajoie & Barbara E. Moo as my main bibliography.

I'll be posting summaries of every section of the book and the solutions for the proposed exercises. 

Let's do it! (:
